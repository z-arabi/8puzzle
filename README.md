# 8puzzle

# Algorithms

The algorithms to search each state of puzzle are DFS (DLS) and BFS (BLS). (use google and youtube for details of the algorithms!)

# How To Play

The user can choose whether he wants to solve his own 8-puzzle or want to see how a random puzzle is solved. So both states must be provided in the interface of the game.

  1. Generating a random 8-puzzle and present the step by step solution.

  2. Get users puzzle information as input and give the step by step solution.
   
All the steps to solve the puzzle, must be shown in a beautiful manner. Also number of steps must be shown.


# Bonus Points

1.  User might want to get to a special state of the puzzle. So there must be an option to change the goal node.
2.  Implementing the search algorithm with Bidirectional Search method will have extra points.
3.  And of course the more beautiful your UI, the better your grade! (you can use ANSI Codes to have a colorful output!)

# Notes
1.  Each student must create a github repository with his/her name for this project. You must have meaningful **commits** during your progress. These commits would be checked and have direct effect in your grade. For the sake of security :) please don't share your repo with other students!

2. In the end, each student must have a report file in pdf format and a presentation file in powerpoint. We would have a session and some random guys would present their work.
